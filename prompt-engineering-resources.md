## Pre-read: Introduction to LLMs

Understanding functioning and constraints of Language Models (LLMs) enables you to effectively formulate prompts that yield the desired outcomes.

- :tv: [State of GPT - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A) - Deep insights into how ChatGPT has been built by [Andrej](https://karpathy.ai/)? :star::star::star:
- :scroll: [State of GPT - Slides](https://karpathy.ai/stateofgpt.pdf)

Foundation Large Language Models (LLMs) aka. Base Models are NOT AI Assistants. 
 - Base model does NOT answer questions
 - Just want to complete internet documents, they are "**_document completers_**".
 - Often _"responds to questions with more questions"._

> Based models are "_tricked into performing tasks_" through "_prompt engineering_".

> Based models can also be "_tricked into assistants_" with "_few shot prompting_".

:point_right: Visit [open-source LLMs leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).

Foundational or Base Large Language Model (LLM) undergo following process to become AI assistants,

| Stage :one: | Stage :two: | Stage :three: | Stage :four: |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--: |
| **Un-supervised learning** | **Supervised Finetuning** | **Reward Modelling** | **Reinforcement Learning** |
| Trained with internnet archive, Wikipedia, books, ... | Finetune with manually composed dataset "_prompt and ideal response_". | Compare multiple completions of a prompt from SFT model and rank them. Perform binary classification, reward best completion. | Generate tokens which maximize reward. |
| Outcome is "_Base Model_" | Outcome "_SFT model_" can act as AI assistants. | Outcome  "Reward Model", cannot be used as assisstant" | Outocome "Reinformcent Learning Model" |

#### LLM Configuration Settings

**Temperature** - LLMs are non-deterministic by design, temparature setting can tweak their behaviour. Lower temperature makes model more deterministic, results pick highest probable next token. Increasing temperature could lead to more randomness encouraging more diverse or creative outputs. [ChatGPT Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)

**Top-K, Top-p Sampling** - LLM takes in an input sequence of tokens and then tries to predict the next token, by generating a discrete probability distribution over all possible tokens. 
- [Top-K sampling](https://peterchng.com/blog/2023/05/02/token-selection-strategies-top-k-top-p-and-temperature/)
- [Top-p sampling](https://peterchng.com/blog/2023/05/02/token-selection-strategies-top-k-top-p-and-temperature/)

Top-K and Top-p operate directly on the output probabilities.

#### LLM limitations / Constraints
- Context window (also called "token limit") limitation. GPT-4 has a token limit of 8,192, with another variant increased to 32,768.
   - [What is Tokenization?](https://ankur3107.github.io/blogs/intro-to-tokenization-using-openai-chatgpt/)
   - [Which tokenization method ChatGPT uses?](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter6/5?fw=pt)
   - [What is difference between Tokens & Word Embeddings?](https://medium.com/@saschametzger/what-are-tokens-vectors-and-embeddings-how-do-you-create-them-e2a3e698e037)
     
- ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff date of 2021, it does not know latest events. It may not have access to latest events, access to updated libraries, frameworks. GPT-4 has web/search plug-in which enables to access external data.

## Prompt Engineering

Prompts trick LLM to perform a given task and they improve models‚Äô responses. A prompt can be a `instruction` or `question` along with `inputs` or `examples`. 

Prompting is nothing but instructing a model what you want to achieve such as "Write", "Classify", "Summarize", "Translate", "Order", ‚Äúparaphrase‚Äù, ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù etc.

## How to come up with good prompts?

Good prompts follow two basic principles: 
- **Clarity**: Use simple, unambiguous language that avoids jargon and overly complex vocabulary. Keep queries short and snappy. Give clear concise instructions.

> :x: Example of an unclear prompt: `Who finished third place in the world cup?`

> :white_check_mark: Example of a clear prompt: `Who clinched the FIFA World Cup 2022 bronze medal?` or `Which country finished third place in the FIFA 2022 world cup?`

- **Specificity**: Tell your model as much as it needs to know to answer your question. More descriptive and detailed the prompt can give you better results.

> :x: Example of an unspecific prompt: `Generate a list of titles for my Youtube video.`

> :white_check_mark: Example of a specific prompt: `Generate a list of ten titles for my Youtube video. The video is about my journey as an adventurer who has lived an unconventional life, meeting many different personalities and finally finding peace in gardening.`

### A Typical Prompt Template

A prompt template usually follows below structure,

> **A Fresh Start**: `Ignore all previous instructions. Your new role and persona is:` 

> **Role Play**: `You are a` ... More about role play is [here]().

> **Context Setting**: Supplying additional context enhances model's understanding and generate more accurate and relevant responses. Context can be response format, length, information from an article or dataset, and tone, hepls model to tailor its output to the given situation, making it more unique and engaging. Avoid hallucinations by including statements like, `Do not make up stuff, if you don't know the real answer, say don't know.` ‚ÄúHallucination‚Äù refers to a phenomenon where the model generates text that is incorrect, nonsensical, or not real.

> **Acknowledgment**: `Acknowledge that you understood above by responding ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and stay idle.`

> **Final Instruction/Question**: {Your question or instruction goes here ...}

A perfect prompt sample (non-technical),

Source: [Level Up Prompt Engineering in 8 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qos2rG3zVAM)

```markdown
Ignore all previous instructions. Here is your new role and persona:

You will create a detailed easy to follow diet and excercise plan for the USER. Also make a accountability plan. Be very helpful and motivating. Acknowledge this by answering "Yes" and stay idle:

Here are some context I found in my research:

**** Intermittent Fasting for Weight Loss ****

{Include intermittent fasting search results content here ...}

Can you confirm that you have read this by answering "Yes":

Now write a detailed and personal plan for me to lose 7 kgs in next 60 days based on all the context I have provided.
```

A perfect developer prompt sample,

```markdown
Ignore all my previous instructions. I want you to act as a `{Python / Full Stack / GoLang}` developer.

```

:tada: Hey, can you show more such [coding prompt examples](https://github.com/RimaBuilds/Master-coding-prompts-with-ChatGPT/tree/main)?

### Role Play

The outputs of a foundation model without any customization tends to be generic and similar across different users.

Role play shapes AI‚Äôs behavior to cater to specific use cases, which can lead to more accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses. It shows significant improvements in the quality of the answers.

- `I want you to act as an` ... (DevOps engineer / Product Manager / Rapper). 
- `You are a` ... (customer support manager, marketing content creator, ...).

e.g., `You are an excellent copywriter` skilled at crafting emails that use active verbs to engage recipients. Please write an email of fewer than 150 words that encourages the reader to attend a webinar. Include three options for the email‚Äôs subject line.

- https://www.allabtai.com/chatgpt-4-prompt-engineering-the-ultimate-problem-solver-prompt/
  
### Style / Tone

Give the AI specific instructions on how to format the output, including the tone, style, length, tense, and point of view (first, second, or third person) you want it to write in.

e.g., Be very helpful and motivating. Be polite. Be sarcastic and funny in your approach.

### Logical Reasoning

:question: **Problem**: ‚Äú_I have a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug. I want to measure 6 liters. How do I do it?_‚Äù
 
:-1: :poop: ChatGPT stumbles to answer. But GPT-4 can answer.

```markdown
To measure exactly 6 liters using a 12-liter jug and a 6-liter jug, you can follow these steps:
- Fill the 12-liter jug completely with water.
- Pour the water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug. This will leave you with 6 liters of water in the 12-liter jug.
- Empty the 6-liter jug.
- ...
- Pour water from the 12-liter jug into the 6-liter jug until it is full. This time, you will only need to pour 1 liter of water, as there are already 5 liters in the 6-liter jug.
- You now have 6 liters of water in the 12-liter jug.
```

`Chain of Thought` prompting makes LLM to thought through and reason about.

### Question Answering

- [Multiple Choice Questions](https://learnprompting.org/docs/applied_prompting/mc_tutorial)

### Chat / Conversation

Base models are NOT 'Assistants', they can be tricked to be assistants by, Few-shot Prompt + Make it look like a document + Query completion. For example,

```markdown
[Human]
Hi, How are you?

[Assistant]
I'm great, thank you for asking. How can I help you?

[Human]
I would like to know what is 2+2 thanks

[Assistant] 2+2 is 4

[Human]
What is the capital of Andhra Pradesh state in India?

[Assistant]
```

- ChatGPT / GPT-4 are already assistants, you no need to do anything.

## Advanced Programmable Prompting

Applications in realworld scenarios realize use cases as a series of tasks. The tasks are performed in certain order to achieve a goal, wherein preceding task's outcome decides next task. 

As LLMs has logical reasoning capabailities, we can use them to automate execution of tasks. We can use LLMs reasoning to chain these tasks to achieve the goal. LLMs can be used to analyse a task output and select next appropriate task. 

**Trend**: :hourglass: LLM powered "**Autonomous AI Agents**" ü§ñ are the trend of today, they automate complex application tasks. 

For example, an Autonomous AI agents powered by LLMs can "Book a economy class flight ticket from Bangalore to Mumbai for next Sunday evening". Booking a airline ticket involves following set of tasks,

LLM powered Agent: Understand customer request and come up with list of sub-tasks to acheive the goal.
- Task 1: Search for flights on www.google.com, www.cheapflights.com, ariline websites, ...
- Task 2: Compare ticket prices, look at user reviews & ratings, journey duration, timings and more.
- Task 3: Generate summary of travel options along with cost, duration and timings.
- Task 4: Invoke airlines API ...

**ü•á Popular Autonomous AI Agents**:
- [Godmode.space](https://godmode.space/)
- [Agent GPT](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/)
- [Baby AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)
- [Auto GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

:fire: **Crazy Thought** - In future there won't be REST APIs, LLM powered AI agents talk to each other in natural language to peform tasks. Every company will have their own AI agents.
